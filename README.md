# 🆓 free-zap-baseline-scan ⚡️

A GitHub-powered (Actions & Issues) security testing tool using [ZAP baseline scan](https://github.com/zaproxy/action-baseline) to quickly identify vulnerabilities in web applications.

## 🧪 WIP
This experiment is still a work in progress. 

## Overview
This project provides an automated GitHub Actions workflow that leverages [ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)](https://www.zaproxy.org/) to perform baseline security scans on web applications. By simply creating a *ZAP Scan Request* issue in this repository with your target URL, you can get detailed security reports - completely free and without setting up any infrastructure.

## Quick Start
### Basic Usage
1️⃣ Open a *ZAP Scan Request* issue to begin.

2️⃣ Results will be posted as a comment on the issue. 

3️⃣ It should only take 2-3 minutes to complete the scan.

4️⃣ Simply check the issue comments in a few minutes for the results.

⚠️ Please ensure that the URL is valid and accessible. Invalid URLs may result in failed scans.

## How It Works
When you submit a *ZAP Scan Request* issue with the correct title, label, and URL, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- Detects and extracts the URL from your issue
- Runs a ZAP baseline scan against the provided URL
- Posts a scan summary and links to the full scan artifacts as a comment on your issue

## Understanding the Results
The scan results include:
- **Alert Summary**: Quick overview of alerts by risk level.
- **Findings List**: Specific issues detected during scanning.
- **Download Links**: Access to full report files for deeper analysis. 
- **Detailed Reports**: HTML, Markdown, and JSON reports available as downloadable artifacts.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions listed in reports to address identified vulnerabilities.

## Limitations
- It is intended for preliminary security checks and should not replace comprehensive security testing.
- Only performs a baseline scan (passive analysis), which is quick but not exhaustive.
- URLs must be publicly accessible from GitHub's infrastructure.
- Limited to public-facing websites and web applications.
- Does not perform authenticated testing. 

## Privacy & Usage Guidelines
- Scan results are not stored long-term (reports are available as artifacts for limited time)
- This tool is provided for educational, development, and testing purposes 
- Scan data is subject to GitHub's data retention policies
